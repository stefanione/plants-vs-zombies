# Plants-VS-Zombies

This is a game coded in C++. The design is minimalistic but the concepts are pretty complex. The meshes are made manually and so the animations. The idea of the game si to survive enemy attacks. The enemies are spawned randomnly. To survive the attacks the player must use cannons which vary based on both color and price. The cannons can shoot down only enemies corresponding to their colour. To purchase cannons, stars will be used which spawn randomnly on the screen. To collect them, the player has to select them using the mouse. 

The Game also features a drag&drop system, where the player has to select a cannon and place it on the matrix. If there is not enough currency, the cannon will not be placed on the matrix. This mechanic adds a strategic layer, requiring players to manage resources wisely while defending against enemy attacks.
