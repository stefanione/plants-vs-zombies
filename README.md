# Plants-VS-Zombies

This game, developed in C++, features a minimalist design paired with complex gameplay mechanics. The 3D models and animations are manually crafted, enhancing the game's custom feel. The primary objective is for the player to survive waves of enemy attacks, which are spawned randomly.

To defend against these attacks, players utilize a variety of cannons, each differentiated by both color and price. Each cannon is capable of targeting and destroying only enemies that match its designated color. Cannons can be purchased using stars, which appear randomly on the screen. Players collect these stars by interacting with them via the mouse.

Additionally, the game incorporates a drag-and-drop mechanic, allowing players to select and place cannons on a grid. If the playerâ€™s currency is insufficient, the cannon cannot be placed on the grid, adding a layer of resource management. This mechanic requires strategic thinking, as players must efficiently allocate resources to defend against increasingly difficult waves of enemies.
